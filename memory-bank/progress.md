# Progress Status: klox

## Current Project Status

klox is currently a fully functional proof-of-concept implementation that demonstrates the O(1) garbage collection approach. The project has reached its primary goal of showing that the proposed memory management strategy can work in practice.

## What Works

### Core Functionality

- ✅ Full Lox language implementation (all features from clox)
- ✅ O(1) garbage collection mechanism
- ✅ Concurrent GC with main thread coordination
- ✅ Tri-partite memory model (A/B/C regions)
- ✅ Test suite passing
- ✅ REPL and script execution

### Memory Management

- ✅ Power-of-2 ring buffer implementation
- ✅ Object handle system with O(log32(n)) lookup
- ✅ Copy-on-write for objects from read-only regions
- ✅ Proper synchronization between main and GC threads
- ✅ Size-based GC triggering

### Data Structures

- ✅ Integration with cb's structmap_amt for O(log32(n)) mapping
- ✅ Partially-persistent red-black tree
- ✅ PIN_SCOPE mechanism for object lifetime extension

### Performance Analysis

- ✅ Performance comparison with original clox implementation
- ✅ Instruction-level timing measurements
- ✅ Documentation of performance tradeoffs

## In Progress/Needs Improvement

### Implementation Refinements

- ✅ Migrated structmap_amt implementation to cb library
- 🔄 PIN_SCOPE implementation has some edge cases that need addressing
- 🔄 Error handling could be improved in some areas
- 🔄 Some code sections could benefit from better documentation
- 🔄 Some code sections could benefit from refactoring into smaller, clearer routines


### Performance Optimizations

- 🔄 Leverage optimizations in cb's structmap_amt implementation
- 🔄 More efficient implementation of deriveMutableObjectLayer()
- 🔄 Investigation of specialized handling for frequently accessed objects

### Testing and Validation

- 🔄 Need more stress tests specifically for the GC mechanism
- 🔄 Testing with larger and more complex programs
- 🔄 More detailed performance benchmarks for specific scenarios

## Not Yet Started

### Potential Future Enhancements

- ⏳ Language feature exploration leveraging the memory model
- ⏳ Further optimization of region management strategy
- ⏳ Integration with different language frontends
- ⏳ Tooling for memory visualization and debugging

### Documentation

- ⏳ Comprehensive API documentation for core data structures
- ⏳ Detailed explanation of memory model for potential adopters
- ⏳ Tutorial-style documentation for understanding the implementation

## Known Issues

### Technical Limitations

1. **PIN_SCOPE Limitations**:
   - Some edge cases in PIN_SCOPE usage may be insufficient for protection
   - These do not undermine the overall concept but would need fixing in a production version

2. **Performance Hotspots**:
   - Object property access operations show significant slowdown (OP_GET_PROPERTY, OP_SET_PROPERTY)
   - Method invocation operations (OP_INVOKE, OP_SUPER_INVOKE) have increased latency

3. **Memory Sizing**:
   - The continuous buffer may need resizing during execution, which is expensive
   - Ideally, program memory size should be known or well-estimated in advance

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Complexity**:
   - The memory management approach is complex and requires careful reasoning
   - This increases the risk of subtle bugs in modifications or extensions

2. **Debugging Difficulty**:
   - Memory-related issues can be hard to diagnose due to the unique memory model
   - The tri-partite region structure adds complexity to debugging

## Metrics and Benchmarks

### Performance Changes

Key performance metrics (measured in rdtsc ticks) show the tradeoffs:

- **OP_INVOKE**: 75.5 → 264.7 (+250.5%)
- **OP_GET_PROPERTY**: 44.9 → 101.2 (+125.4%)
- **OP_GET_GLOBAL**: 30.9 → 96.3 (+211.8%)
- **OP_SET_GLOBAL**: 42.5 → 348.2 (+718.9%)
- **OP_RETURN**: 27.2 → 53.9 (+98.3%)
- **OP_CALL**: 51.5 → 139.5 (+171.0%)

These metrics confirm the expected tradeoff: significantly higher costs for dereferencing operations in exchange for O(1) GC performance.

## Next Milestone Goals

1. **Code Organization**:
   - ✅ Migrated structmap_amt.h to cb library
   - 🔄 Identify additional code that could be migrated to cb
   - 🔄 Maintain clean separation between memory management and runtime

2. **Address PIN_SCOPE Limitations**:
   - Identify and fix the known edge cases
   - Improve the safety of the mechanism

2. **Performance Enhancement Focus**:
   - Identify optimization opportunities for frequently used operations
   - Explore specialized handling for common access patterns

3. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Create more detailed technical documentation
   - Provide clearer explanations of the memory model

4. **Further Testing**:
   - Develop more targeted stress tests
   - Test with a wider variety of programs

## Success Criteria Status

- ✅ **Functioning Interpreter**: Complete and passes test suite
- ✅ **O(1) GC Implementation**: Successfully implemented and working
- ✅ **Performance Evaluation**: Completed with detailed metrics
- 🔄 **Documentation**: Basic documentation complete, but could be expanded
