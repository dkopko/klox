# System Patterns: klox

## Memory Architecture

The core innovation in klox is its tri-partite memory model that enables O(1) garbage collection. The system divides memory into three regions (A, B, C) within a power-of-2 sized ring buffer.

### Memory Regions

1. **Region A**: The mutable region
   - Only region where mutation of structures occurs
   - Where new objects are allocated
   - Structures from B or C must be copied here before modification

2. **Regions B and C**: Read-only regions
   - Cannot be modified directly
   - Contain objects from previous GC cycles
   - Accessed during dereference operations

### Object Resolution Hierarchy

When dereferencing an object handle, the system searches:
1. First in region A (newest objects/mutations)
2. Then in region B (previous cycle)
3. Finally in region C (oldest active objects)

This layered approach allows for efficient concurrent garbage collection while maintaining program correctness.

## Garbage Collection Process

The GC implementation achieves essentially O(1) performance through a careful coordination between the main and GC threads:

### Main Thread GC Workflow

1. **Normal Execution**: Main thread runs with 2 active regions (A and B contain data, C is empty)
2. **GC Initiation**:
   - Regions shift: C = B, B = A, A = new region (now empty)
   - Request sent to GC thread to compact live objects of B and C into "newB"
   - This request transmission is brief and constant time
3. **Continued Execution**: Main thread continues running with 3 active regions while GC thread works
4. **GC Integration**:
   - GC thread completes compaction and sends response
   - Main thread integrates response: C = empty, B = newB
   - This integration step is brief and constant time
5. **Resume Normal Execution**: Main thread continues with 2 active regions

### Region Management

- **Region Shifting**: A critical operation that changes the role of each region during GC cycles
- **Read-Only Enforcement**: Ensures B and C regions cannot be modified after freezing
- **Copy-on-Write**: Objects in B or C are copied to region A when modifications are needed

## Key Data Structures

### Continuous Buffer (`struct cb`)

- Power-of-2-sized ring implementation
- Acts as the foundation for all memory allocations
- Allocations return offsets into this ring instead of pointers
- Manages resizing when needed using power-of-2 sizes

### Object IDs and References

- **ObjID**: A unique identifier for GC-managed objects
- **cb_offset_t**: A location within the ring buffer
- **CBO\<T>**: A ring buffer offset reference (O(1) dereference)
- **OID\<T>**: An object ID reference (O(log32(n)) dereference)

### Structure Map (`struct structmap_amt`)

- An O(log32(n)) uint64_tâ†’uint64_t map
- Primary use: mapping ObjID to cb_offset_t locations
- Inspired by Hash Array Mapped Tries (HAMT)
- Designed for efficiency in the context of the memory model

### Red-Black Tree (`struct cb_bst`)

- Partially-persistent red-black tree implementation
- Supports the underlying memory management system

## Object Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Objects are allocated in region A with a unique ObjID
2. **Access**: Objects are dereferenced via OID\<T>::clip() (to obtain a pointer to a const object) or OID\<T>::mlip() (to obtain a pointer to a non-const object)
3. **Modification**:
   - If in region A: Direct modification
   - If in regions B or C: Copied to A via deriveMutableObjectLayer() before modification
4. **Collection**: When GC runs, live objects are compacted into a new region

## Concurrency Model

- **Main Thread**: Handles program execution, freezes regions, and initiates GC
- **GC Thread**: Performs compaction of live objects concurrently
- **Synchronization**: Uses request/response mechanism between threads
- **Integration Points**: GC responses are integrated during specific VM operations

## Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

### Performance Shift

The design explicitly shifts costs:
- GC and allocation become O(1) operations
- Object dereference becomes O(log32(n)) rather than O(1)

### Memory Constraints

- Uses power-of-2 sized ring buffer
- Resize operations are possible but expensive
- To avoid ring buffer resize costs, program memory size (to a power-of-2) should be well-estimated in advance

### Implementation Complexity

- Complex reference handling with multiple pointer types
- Careful synchronization between main and GC threads
- Memory safety ensured through assertion-oriented programming

## Pin Mechanism

- **PIN_SCOPE**: Extends the lifetime of allocated data
- Prevents data from being collected during scope execution
- Critical for operations that might trigger GC

## Error Handling and Safety

- Heavy use of assertions to catch invariant violations
- Serial number arithmetic for offset comparisons
- Careful management of object copying to ensure consistency
